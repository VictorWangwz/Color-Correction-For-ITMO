# ColorCorrectionForITMO
Multimedia System Project on Color Correction for iTMO

September, 2017 â€“ December, 2017

- Implemented two types of color correction for the results of four iTMO methods, which are separately named global color correction, an image-specific method, and local color correction, an iTMO-specific method

- Coded to generate maps for alpha of different L, A, B values in CIELab color space and adjusted the color of iTMO output with different alpha values

- Applied subjective and objective test to prove that the color-corrected HDR images have a closer color appearance to the original SDR image compared with the output of iTMOs
